/*

There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).



*/

//Solution

long pillars(int num_of_pillars, int distance, int width) {
  if (num_of_pillars <= 1)
    return 0;
   return (num_of_pillars - 2)*width + distance*(num_of_pillars-1)*100;
}
