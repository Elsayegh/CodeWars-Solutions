/*
Gradually discounted milk price
We have to implement a milkPrice function that returns the milk price reduced by a volume discount system that will lower the milk price per liter every 2 liters of milk.

The discount system is very simple, every 2 litres the milk price is reduced by $0.05.

For example

Price per liter: $1.23 you buy 5 liters

2 liters at 1.18
2 liters at 1.13
1 liters at 1.13

Milk price: $5.75
The final result should be rounded with only 2 decimals.

Note: partial liters should be managed.

//Solution

double milkPrice(double litres, double pricePerLitre)
{   
    double totalPrice = pricePerLitre * litres - 0.05 * floor(litres / 2) * (1 + litres - floor(litres / 2)) ;
    return round(totalPrice * 100) / 100. ;  
}
